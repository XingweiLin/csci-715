        <h2>Goal of the Project</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project was to create a lighting system for augmented reality objects that was based on the environmental lighting. 
            Specifically making sure it lights AR objects well in environments with radically different lighting conditions.
            Ideally, it would include shadows, ambient lighting, and specular highlights, color information.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>How It Was Built</h2>
        <p>Key steps in building this project included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The lighting system was designed using a modular architecture within Unity, allowing for scalable and maintainable integration of various lighting components.
                We used HDR Light Estimation to accurately capture and represent the full spectrum of environmental lighting. This was achieved using device sensors and camera data to analyze the surrounding light conditions in real-time.
            </li>
            <li>Utilized Unity's real-time shadow mapping techniques to cast realistic shadows from AR objects based on the detected environmental light sources.</li>
            <li>Enabled adaptive color adjustments that respond to changes in ambient light, maintaining the visual integrity of AR objects under varying lighting conditions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>Throughout this project, I gained insights into:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AR techniques such as plane detection, object placement, AR markers, interacting with Android APIs</li>
            <li>Lighting estimation and shader techniques</li>
            <li>XR in Unity</li>
            <li>User interaction and user experience</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What to Do Next?</h2>
        <p>Future improvements for this project could include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enhance IDE Compatibility: Optimize the project for seamless integration across different Integrated Development Environments such as Android Studio and Xcode within Unity</li>
            <li>Animation Optimization: Utilize more efficient animation algorithms and tools to enhance the smoothness and realism of animations while reducing resource consumption.</li>
            <li>Cross-Device Optimization: Optimize performance for various hardware platforms, including different VR headsets and mobile devices, to ensure a consistent and high-quality user experience across all devices.</li>
            <li>Enhance Light Simulation: Incorporate more sophisticated lighting simulation technologies, such as global illumination and real-time ray tracing, to achieve more realistic lighting effects.</li>
        </ul>
